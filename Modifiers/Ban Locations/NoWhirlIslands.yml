Name: No Whirl Islands
Description: Prevents items needed to defeat red from being located in Whirl Islands. Whirl isn't really a bad check, I don't know why you want to enable this, its really not that hard an area, I promise. Note that non-progress items can still be placed in this location while this setting is enabled.
