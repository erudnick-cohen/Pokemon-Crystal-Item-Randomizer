Description: Most items which require daily events, day-night events or happiness
  checks are are included under these settings. This includes the berry trees. Note
  that this mode includes additional hidden items, any hidden item hidden under a
  weekday sibling has been moved one tile. Issues encountered with these items should
  be reported to Choatix, and not ERC or Vicendithas. Read the modifiers to further
  understand how this differs from standard and tricky. Hidden items are included
  in the item pool. For a complete list of what hidden items are used by the randomizer,
  please consult Vicendithas and Dillon's emotracker plugin. Any issues with hidden
  items should be reported to Vicendithas and not ERC. Expected completion time is
  between 20 minutes and 4 hours for experienced players. Items and badges are shuffled
  interchangably. Gyms may not be required to beat the game. This mode allows for
  the largest number of skips relative to any other mode. It is strongly recommended
  that the emotracker package for Crystal Full Item Rando is used, unless you're certain
  you've memorized every item location. All items and badges (item balls, gift items,
  TMs, HMs, key items, pokegear cards, pokedex, berry trees, etc...) in the game have
  their locations randomly shuffled.  Remember, you can't spell crazy without any
  trees.
