Name: Nightmare Logic
Description: This setting isn't meant to be fun. It's customary to also turn on spinner hell. If you're feeling especially brave, turn off the force fully evolved setting as well. The item pool is noticeably worse than on other settings. All settings to prevent fighting potentially impossible bosses early have been disabled, but you're a Pokemon Crystal master, so this shouldn't be an issue right? People have complained about Fly's location deciding races, so we've upgraded HM02 to now teach Splash instead of Fly. The bike can now be anywhere in the game, including Mt. Silver. Items now grow on trees and daily events and happiness checks are included (gotta have all the checks after all). The logic is set to maximum evil mode. We have also added the bug catching contest (all four placing are a check) into the randomizer for this difficulty level. I assure you that third place is possible, just keep at it. Players are no longer able to skip Elm, to get that vintage experience of playing the original Pokemon Crystal. Cut tree has managed to regrow, so as to better match the object which is definitely a tree blocking Route 36. Fighting the Elite 4 is required because logically red must not exist unless you are the champion. Clair is vanilla because long cutscenes with music that doesn't play elsewhere are important Johtonian cultural heritage. Tin tower is on (as is the good ole Ho-Oh chamber in Ruins of Alph) and the Pokegear and company are also shuffled (to test your menuing skillz). Rods are progressive, so no cheating by getting early super rod. Mt. Silver can be entered early, which isn't terrible really. Pointless checks are included because Wynaut? Evil phone call trainers and evil people asking you to show them pokemon will have checks and will make you a very unhappy person. NPC trash cans are shuffled. One of these statements is a lie. The seed will still be beatable, but who knows how long it will take, or if you'll even be able to.
